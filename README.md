# LanguageApp

Welcome to my LanguageApp, this is extremely difficult as ive been using it just for experience with using Dictonary in C# 
not many challenges but the console doesnt want to display some languages 
I tried fixing it by setting console encoding to UTF-16 and UTF-8

// Set console encoding to UTF-16 (Unicode)
            Console.OutputEncoding = Encoding.Unicode;
right now im using UTF-16 testing in this Alpha version if UTF-16 fixes this issue 
The idea for the app is just to open and select between dark mode and light mode in your command prompt by pressing 1 or 2
after youve selected your theme it will tell you what language has been chosen for you and the translation
at the moment Ive only done "hello" and "goodbye"
